# Employee Task & Performance Intelligence Platform

This is a production-grade workforce management platform that enables managers to assign tasks, monitor team productivity, and generate AI-driven performance insights.

The system goes beyond traditional employee management by providing **predictive analytics**, **workload intelligence**, and **risk detection** powered by Machine Learning.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

Modern teams struggle with:

* Lack of visibility into employee workload
* Subjective performance reviews
* Late discovery of task delays
* Poor task distribution
* No early burnout detection

We solve these problems using **data-driven insights and ML predictions**.

---

# ⭐ Manager Dashboard (Intelligence Hub)

The Manager Dashboard is the **central decision-making screen** that provides real-time and predictive insights.

## 🔥 Dashboard Capabilities

### 📊 KPI Summary

* Total employees
* Active tasks
* Overdue tasks
* Average performance score

---

### 🧭 Team Workload Heatmap

Shows capacity utilization for each employee.

**Formula:**

```
workload % = assigned_task_hours / weekly_capacity_hours
```

**Benefits:**

* Detect overloaded employees
* Balance work distribution
* Improve planning

---

### 🚨 Delay Risk Prediction (ML)

Predicts probability of task delay.

**Example Output:**

```
Payment API → 78% risk
Mobile UI → 64% risk
```

**Model Inputs:**

* Task complexity
* Employee workload
* Historical delay rate
* Task age

---

### 🔥 Overloaded Employees Panel

Flags employees whose workload exceeds capacity.

**Rule (v1):**

```
if workload > 100% → overloaded
```

---

### 📈 Task Completion Trend

Weekly productivity visualization showing:

* Tasks completed per week
* Team velocity
* Performance trend

---

### ⚠️ Burnout Risk Detection

Identifies employees at risk of burnout.

**Signals Used:**

* Sustained high workload
* Increasing delay rate
* Excess active tasks

**Risk Levels:**

* LOW
* MEDIUM
* HIGH
